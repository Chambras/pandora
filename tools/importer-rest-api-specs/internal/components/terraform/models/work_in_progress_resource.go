// WorkInProgressResource is an intermediate type used by the `terraform` package to enable
// building a Terraform Resource component-by-component. It contains both the WIP Resource,
// the InputData used to identify the resource (which can in turn contain test data and defaults)
// but is ultimately only used within this package to build Resources.
//
// NOTE: this should only be used within the `terraform` package - with the SDK Model `TerraformResourceDefinition`
// used elsewhere.
