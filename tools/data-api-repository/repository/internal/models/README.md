## `./tools/data-api-repository/internal/models`

These Models directly represent the files stored within `./api-definitions` and are internal to this repository - and get transformed to and from the SDK Models defined in `./tools/data-api-sdk/v1/models`.

Note: these models want to be renamed in order to align with those in `data-api-sdk`, but that'll be done separately.
